What is Platooning Litecoin?
----------------

Platooning Litecoin enables instant payments for Platooning.
It is built upon and fully synched with the Litecoin project, any changes in the Litecoin project (https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin)
will be merged into Platooning Litecoin. The folder "driveme" contains the files to calculate the amount of money saved because of the reduced wind drag in a vehicle platoon.

Translations
------------

We only accept translation fixes that are submitted through [Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).
Translations are converted to Litecoin periodically.

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.
